# PWM

By implementing this design on FPGA, we can see a LED go on and off with certain duty cycle. (Pulse Width Modulation signal)
The duty cycle is controlled by another LED(input button/key), if this led is on, it means the duty cycle should be increase, and the case of the led being off just go the other way around.
